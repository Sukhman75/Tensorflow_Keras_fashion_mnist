If you are using latest version of python i.e 3.7 you will face an error while installing or during the import because there is no update for tensorflow in latest version of python. That's why I used a virtual environment in Anaconda to test/run the code or you can use the older version of python that is 3.6.*. 
 
To create virtual environment for Tensorflow:
1) Download and install Anaconda for python
2) Open Anaconda Prompt and Type:
~ conda create -n yourenvname
~ activate yorenvname
~ pip install tensorflow...
